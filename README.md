# Mission-to-Mars
 
## Summary
The purpose of this challenge was to be able to web-scrape and pull/extract information through autmated browsing using the Splinter methoad and also parsing the HTmL through Beautiful Shop. In Deliverable one we web-scraped through the Mars news website and was able to extract the title and preview text, or summary text, of each article on the landing page in the website. I hope I did this part correctly. In Deliverable 2 we scraped date and created and pandas dataframe. We then were able to calculate the min and max temps in Mars. With the help of finding the radians, I was able to find the rotation or sols elapsed in mars by 'Martian Months'. I was more shocked to find out that the length of one earth day (23 hours and 56 minutes) and the length of one mars day isn't that far off (1d and 37 minutes). With the help of that we were able to compute and see Sols elapsed in a martian year based of the number of times it elasped per months. With that data we were also able to visualize and show how many days there in a year at mars. On average we estimated 688. Which tells us that mars rotates around the sun slower than earth which leads to longer seasons of weather changes. All in all this challenge was fun to be able to scrape some date off a website in a controlled browser. I think it'll get more easier to be able to do it after repitions for it.
