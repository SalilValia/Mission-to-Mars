# Mission-to-Mars
 
## Summary
The purpose of this challenge was to be able to web-scrape and pull/extract information through autmated browsing using the Splinter methoad and also parsing the HTmL through Beautiful Shop. In Deliverable one we web-scraped through the Mars news website and was able to extract the title and preview text, or summary text, of each article on the landing page in the website. I hope I did this part correctly.
